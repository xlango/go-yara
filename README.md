Go bindings for [YARA](https://virustotal.github.io/yara/), staying as
close as sensible to the library's C-API while taking inspiration from
the `yara-python` implementation.

## Installation

### Unix

On a Unix system with _libyara_ 3.11, corresponding header files, and
_pkg-config_ installed, the following should simply work:

```
go get github.com/hillu/go-yara
go install github.com/hillu/go-yara
```

The _pkg-config_ program should be able to output the correct compiler
and linker flags from the `yara.pc` file that has been generated and
installed by _YARA_'s build system. If _libyara_ has been installed to
a custom location, the `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` environment variable can be
used to point _pkg-config_ at the right `yara.pc` file. If
_pkg-config_ cannot be used at all, please refer to the "Build Tags" section.

Linker errors in the compiler output such as

    undefined reference to `yr_compiler_add_file'

indicate that the linker is probably looking at an old version of
_libyara_.

### Cross-building

_go-yara_ can be cross-built for a different CPU
architecture/operating system platform, provided a C cross-compiler
for the target platform is available to be used by the _cgo_ tool.

After the _yara_ library has been built from its source tree using the
proper C cross-compiler through the usual `configure / make / make
install` steps, _go-yara_ can be built and installed. Some environment
variables need to be set when running `go build` or `go install`:

- `GOOS`, `GOARCH` indicate the cross compilation target.
- `CGO_ENABLED` has to be set to 1 beacuse it defaults to 0 when
  cross-compiling.
- `CC` has to specified because _cgo_ has no prior knowledge about
  what C compiler to chose for cross-compiling. (it defaults to the
  system C compiler, usually gcc).
- `PKG_CONFIG_PATH` has to be set in so that _pkg-config_ which is run
  by _cgo_ for determining compiler and linker flags can find the
  `yara.pc` file generated while cross-building _yara_.

#### Example: Cross-building for Windows on Debian/streach

Install the MinGW C compiler `gcc-mingw-w64-i686`,
`gcc-mingw-w64-x86-64` for Win32, Win64, respectively.

Build _libyara_ and _go-yara_ for Win32:
```
$ cd ${YARA_SRC} \
  && ./bootstrap.sh \
  && ./configure --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --disable-magic --disable-cuckoo --without-crypto --prefix=${YARA_SRC}/i686-w64-mingw32 \
  && make -C ${YARA_SRC} \
  && make -C ${YARA_SRC} install 
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 \
  CC=i686-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${YARA_SRC}/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig \
  go inxstall -ldflags '-extldflags "-static"' github.com/hillu/go-yara
```

Build _libyara_ and _go-yara_ for Win64:
```
$ cd ${YARA_SRC} \
  && ./bootstrap.sh \
  && ./configure --host=x86_64-w64-mingw32 --disable-magic --disable-cuckoo --without-crypto --prefix=${YARA_SRC}/x86_64-w64-mingw32 \
  && make -C ${YARA_SRC} \
  && make -C ${YARA_SRC} install 
$ GOOS=windows GOARCH=amd64 CGO_ENABLED=1 \
  CC=x86_64-w64-mingw32-gcc \
  PKG_CONFIG_PATH=${YARA_SRC}/x86_64-w64-mingw32/lib/pkgconfig \
  go install -ldflags '-extldflags "-static"' github.com/hillu/go-yara
```

## YARA 3.x vs. YARA 4.x

The release of YARA 4.0.0 introduces some API incompatibilities,
therefore I have decided to break compatibility with YARA 3.x for the
4.0.0 release of _go-yara_ which lives on the `master` branch.

Versions of _go-yara_ compatible with YARA 3.x (>= 3.11) live on the
`v3.x` branch.

## Build Tags

The build tag `yara_static` can be used to tell the Go toolchain to
run _pkg-config_ with the `--static` switch. This is not enough for a
static build; the appropriate linker flags (e.g. `-extldflags
"-static"`) still need to be passed to the _go_ tool.

The build tag `no_pkg_config` can be used to tell the Go toolchain not
to use _pkg-config_'s output. In this case, any compiler or linker
flags have to be set via the `CGO_CFLAGS` and `CGO_LDFLAGS`
environment variables, e.g.:

```
export CGO_CFLAGS="-I${YARA_SRC}/libyara/include"
export CGO_LDFLAGS="-L${YARA_SRC}/libyara/.libs -lyara"
go install -tags no_pkg_config github.com/hillu/go-yara
```
